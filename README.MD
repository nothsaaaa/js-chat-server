# js-chat-server
lightweight chatserver written in javascript
possibly the most complete websocket chatserver

## Public Server
I host a public server 24/7 for discussion of js-chat-server development!

* [Web Client](http://147.185.221.28:53325) 
* Server IP: 147.185.221.28:61429

I encourage you to test your clients with this server and say hi!

---

## Overview

The server is a WebSocket server. It allows multiple clients to:

* Connect with or without a username
* Receive chat and system messages
* Run modular-like chat commands, as well as hardcoded commands for authorization
* View recent chat history on connection

---

## Community Clients
* [Python QT6 Client](https://github.com/nothsaaaa/js-chat-server/tree/master/examples/client/python-qt)

Open a pull request to add your client's repo to the list.
